# transaction-verifier-distributed-server
This repository is for a 3rd party distributed server that prevents fraud by verifying cryptocurrency transactions before they are added to the blockchain maintained by miners who earns commission by doing requests. The server will be able to verify transactions from any blockchain and protect even bridge applications from fraud.

# This vision is for a 
3rd party server that prevents fraud by verifying cryptocurrency transactions before they are added to the blockchain. This would help to ensure that only legitimate transactions are added to the blockchain, and would help to reduce the amount of fraudulent activity that takes place within the cryptocurrency space. This server would work to verify transactions by looking at various factors, such as the amount being transferred, the addresses involved, and the history of the addresses involved. If a transaction is deemed to be suspicious, it would be flagged and further investigated. This server would also work to provide real-time data on the blockchain, so that users can see which transactions are taking place and can make informed decisions about whether or not to participate in them.

# Goals
1. Verify that the transaction is valid and that the sender has the necessary cryptocurrency to complete the transaction. 
2. Prevent double-spending by ensuring that the same cryptocurrency isn't being used in multiple transactions simultaneously. 
3. Ensure that the transaction is authorized by the correct parties before it is added to the blockchain.
